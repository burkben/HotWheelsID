# Redline V1 implementation

The [spec](SPEC.md) and [issue Definition of Done](ISSUES.md#definition-of-done-applies-to-every-issue)
govern this rollout. GitHub [epic #67](https://github.com/burkben/HotWheelsID/issues/67)
is the source of truth for merge status. Each issue has its own branch and PR.

| Issue | Implementation status |
| --- | --- |
| RL-01 / #68 | Implemented; review evidence below |
| RL-02–RL-18 / #69–#85 | Pending, in order |
| RL-19 / #86 | Out of scope; not started |

## RL-01 — tokens and bundled fonts

Branch: `redline/rl-01-tokens-fonts`, based on `main` after the design handoff merged.

- Added `colorsR` (including status fills, heat ramp and zone colours), `fontR`,
  `radiusR`, `skewR`, and the 17 `typeR` variants. Existing tokens and speed-zone
  boundaries are unchanged.
- Added only the three JS-only Google Fonts packages, with ten face-specific imports
  so unused weights do not enter the export. Font loading uses the existing
  `expo-font` and `expo-splash-screen`; success or failure releases the splash.
- Added `RText`, which resolves flattened style overrides without `fontWeight` or
  `fontStyle`, and removes `fontFamily` after a load failure. Body text scales;
  display/HUD defaults to a 1.3× cap. Numeric styles use tabular figures.
- Added font copyright notices and full OFL texts to `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and
  bundled them for offline reading in Credits.
- Added `/dev/redline`, guarded by `__DEV__` with no navigation entry. It shows the
  palette, every type variant and all ten faces. Production access redirects home.

### Checks and visual evidence

- `npm ci`: passed. The only new dependencies are the three font packages.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed for both workspaces.
- `npm test`: 354 mobile tests and 69 protocol tests passed, including 36 new
  text-resolution cases. Existing tests were not edited.
- `npm run lint --workspace mobile`: passed with zero warnings.
- `npm run web:export --workspace mobile`: passed, 21 routes; exactly ten Redline
  TTF assets exported. The extra route is the development gallery's home redirect.
- Playwright, 390×844 at 2×: inspected all 17 variants and ten loaded faces, verified
  no additional bold/italic synthesis, opened the font licenses offline, and
  deliberately failed font requests to verify the system-font fallback.
- iPhone 17 Pro simulator, iOS 26.5: the existing development client opens the
  gallery with bundled fonts loaded. Native palette and display glyphs agree with
  web and the reference. The Simulator GUI is unavailable in this environment, so
  remaining native specimens were not scrolled for visual inspection. Native splash
  appearance in a release build, VoiceOver,
  physical BLE, haptics, and glass were not validated by this foundation change.
- [Review images and reproduction instructions](review/rl-01/README.md), compared
  with [Main.png](png/Main.png), especially “Paint & tarmac” and “Type on the move”.
- Production web smoke check: `/dev/redline` redirects home, Speed runs in demo
  mode with its existing design, and `/tv` renders its needle gauge.
- Protected paths, store shapes, schema, settings keys, TV code, and existing tests
  have no changes.

### Decisions and deviations

- The gallery adapts the wide identity sheet into a phone column. It verifies
  tokens and faces, not a production-screen redesign. Credits has no reference
  PNG; this issue adds only its font-license card. The Credits restyle is RL-15.
- Where the scale gives several sizes, tokens use the primary screen size; callers
  can choose another specified size. CSS line-height ratios become point values.
  Unspecified line heights use 1.2×. Added plate-size and lap-bar variants retain
  the exact geometry needed by subsequent issues.
- Font-load failure uses regular system text. This deliberately sacrifices the
  racing face so the app stays usable even when bundled fonts cannot load.
- The current `main` already removed the global portal ribbon (PR #66). RL-04 must
  reconcile that current shell with the handoff while preserving controller APIs.

Next: RL-02 motif primitives and the pure, tested race-plate derivation. RL-19 remains excluded.
